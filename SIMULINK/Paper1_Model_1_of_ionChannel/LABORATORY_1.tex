**TASK 1:
-Develop the simplest realistic model to represent the input from a single transducer into a first layer neuron.
-Modify the model to allow the single neuron to encode level of luminosity (night/day and in between). Explain your design choices given the constrains or functionality required.
-Modify the model to allow the system to encode direction of movement of light source (left/right). Explain your design choices given the constrains or functionality required.


**TASK 2:
-Find a suitable phenomenological model that achieves the similar output on each case to the realistically "detailed" model

**TASK 3:
-Quantify performance on the 3 variations of the original "detailed model" such as: sensitivity, level of saturation (active range), and explain the "coding scheme" your design uses.
-Compare to the phenomenological model.

**TASK 4:
-Explain and test how these models can be seen as a memory mechanism.
